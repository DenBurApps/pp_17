These sporting events were special as they united various Greek cities - states and were considered a symbol of peace and justice.\nThe first Olympic Games took place in 776 BC and continued every four years.

  'The role of women in the Olympic movement has come a long way from being banned from participating to achieving full equality. At the beginning of its history, the Olympic Games were an exclusively men\'s event where women\'s participation was prohibited. However, over time and thanks to the persistent efforts of activists and female athletes, the situation began to change. \n The first steps towards equality were taken at the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900, where women were allowed to participate for the first time. They competed in disciplines such as golf, tennis and croquet. However, their participation was limited and not sufficiently recognized. \n In 1928, at the Amsterdam Olympics, women were given the opportunity to participate in athletics for the first time. This was a significant step forward, but there were still limitations. For example, in long- distance running, women were limited in participation. In 1984, at the Los Angeles Olympics, another important step towards full equality was taken. For the first time in the history of the Olympic Games, a women\'s marathon competition was held. This event became a symbol of progress and opened the door for greater participation of women in sports. \n Today women play a huge role in the Olympic movement. They participate in all disciplines and compete equally with men. Women\'s sporting achievements are recognized and valued on an equal basis with men\'s, and female athletes become a source of inspiration and pride for many. \n However, despite significant progress, work remains to achieve full equality for women in the Olympic movement. Questions arise about equal pay, women\'s representation in leadership and support female athletes at all levels. These issues require further discussion and action on the part of the Olympic Movement and society as a whole. \n Thus, the role of women in the Olympic movement has undergone significant changes from a ban on participation to the achievement of full equality. Women today they play an important role in sports and become examples of strength, skill and perseverance. However, work continues to achieve full equality so that all women have the opportunity to express their sporting talents and achieve success at the Olympic Games.',

In 1967, the International Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was created to coordinate and monitor anti-doping activities at the Olympic Games and other international competitions. \n The fight against doping at the Olympic Games has become increasingly tough and effective. Athletes are subject to regular anti-doping testing, both during and outside of competition.

Athletes found to be doping are stripped of their medals, disqualified for a specified period of time and lose the right to participate in future competitions. This sends a powerful message to all athletes about the unacceptability of doping and its consequences. \n However, despite all efforts, the problem of doping in sports still exists. Some athletes and teams continue to try to circumvent the rules and use prohibited substances. This causes distrust and disappointment among fans and other athletes. \n The fight against doping is a continuous process that requires constant improvement and cooperation from all participants in the sports community. The Olympic Games continues to work to improve its anti-doping policies and programs by introducing new methods of detection and doping prevention. \n Ultimately, the fight against doping in sport is not only the responsibility of Olympic Games organizers and anti-doping agencies, but also the responsibility of every athlete.
